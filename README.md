# qsx

Extended CSS selectors for querying the DOM.

Installation:

```bash
# with npm
npm install qsx

# with yarn
yarn add qsx
```

Usage:

```js
let qsx = require('qsx');

qsx(el, ':scope > a');
```

In Node.js, which lacks a built-in DOM environment, you can use [`jsdom`](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom).
